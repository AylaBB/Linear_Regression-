About this project:
Using data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and with a focus on empirical validation of a theoretical framework, I worked with identifying and analyzing potential causal relationships between financial satisfaction and overall life contentment among adults in Sweden. 

Key Highlights:
Data Preparation: I cleansed and prepared the dataset, ensuring its suitability for the analysis.
Statistical Analysis: considering the continuous nature of the dependent variable, I used linear multivariate regression analysis. Additionally, I used conditional regression. 
Model Validation: Diagnostic plots were also used to evaluate the assumptions underlying the linear regression model, confirming its suitability for the dataset.
Visualization: Using the ggplot package, I created visually engaging representations of the regression models, offering intuitive insights into the relationships.
